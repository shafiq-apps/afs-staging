      "whyRequired": {
        "question": "Why is sync required?",
        "answer": "Product sync keeps your filter options up-to-date with your store's products. When you add new products, update variants, or change product information, these changes need to be synced so your filters can accurately display available options like colors, sizes, brands, and other attributes."
      },
      "howOften": {
        "question": "How often are changes applied?",
        "answer": "Product sync runs automatically on a schedule, typically every few hours. When you make changes to your products, they will be reflected in your filters after the next sync completes. You can also manually trigger a sync using the \"Sync Products Now\" button above if you need immediate updates."

      "items": {
        "duration": {
          "question": "How long does a sync take?",
          "answer": "Sync time depends on the number of products in your store. Typically, it takes a few minutes for stores with hundreds of products, and up to 5-10 minutes for stores with thousands of products."
        },
        "performance": {
          "question": "Will syncing affect my store's performance?",
          "answer": "No, product sync runs in the background and does not impact your store's performance or customer experience. Your storefront remains fully functional during the sync process."
        },
        "failure": {
          "question": "What happens if a sync fails?",
          "answer": "If a sync fails, you'll see an error message in the status section. You can try syncing again using the \"Sync Products Now\" button. If the issue persists, check that your products are properly configured and contact support if needed."
        },
        "newFilter": {
          "question": "Do I need to sync after creating a new filter?",
          "answer": "No, new filters automatically use the existing synced product data. You only need to sync when you've made changes to your products, such as adding new products, updating variants, or modifying product attributes."
        },
        "automatic": {
          "question": "Can I schedule automatic syncs?",
          "answer": "Yes, automatic syncs are enabled by default and run periodically to keep your product data up-to-date. You don't need to configure anything - it happens automatically in the background."
