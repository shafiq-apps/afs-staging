When you add new products, update variants, or change product information, these changes need to be synced so your filters can accurately display available options like colors, sizes, brands, and other attributes."

When you make changes to your products, they will be reflected in your filters after the next sync completes. You can also manually trigger a sync using the \"Sync Products Now\" button above if you need immediate updates."

        },
        "performance": {
          "question": "Will syncing affect my store's performance?",

        },
        "failure": {
          "question": "What happens if a sync fails?",

        "newFilter": {
          "question": "Do I need to sync after creating a new filter?",

        },
        "automatic": {
          "question": "Can I schedule automatic syncs?",
          "answer": "Yes, automatic syncs are enabled by default and run periodically to keep your product data up-to-date. You don't need to configure anything - it happens automatically in the background."
