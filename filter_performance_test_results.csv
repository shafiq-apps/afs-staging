Observations:
- API Response Times: Consistently fast (220-235ms) regardless of number of filters
- Filters API and Products API: Both respond in similar timeframes, suggesting good parallel processing
- Image Loading: Becomes the bottleneck as more filters are applied (240ms to 485ms)
- Total Rendering Time: Increases primarily due to image loading, not API calls
- Multiple Filters: API performance remains stable even with 5+ filters
- Main Bottleneck: Image loading from CDN, not server response times

Recommendations:
1. Implement image lazy loading for better perceived performance
2. Use image CDN optimization (WebP format, responsive images)
3. Cache filter metadata on client side to reduce Filters API calls
4. Consider pagination optimization for large result sets
5. API performance is excellent - no optimization needed for server response times
6. Consider debouncing filter changes to reduce rapid API calls
